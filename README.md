This project is a real-time route optimization application that calculates the shortest possible path from a source node to every other node in the network. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm, a popular graph traversal algorithm, to find the most efficient paths. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Features
Real-Time Route Calculation: Computes the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in real-time.
Visualization: Provides a visual representation of the network and the optimized routes.
User-Friendly Interface: Built using HTML and CSS for an intuitive user experience.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to ensure efficient and accurate route optimization.
Technologies Used
HTML & CSS: For structuring and styling the user interface.
JavaScript: For implementing the logic of Dijkstra's algorithm and managing real-time updates.
Data Structures & Algorithms: Knowledge of graph theory and shortest path algorithms was applied.
